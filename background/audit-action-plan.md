## Issue 2. Institutional Open Data Guiding Framework ##

As the Open Data Initiative has grown organically and evolved over the last three years, an institutional guiding framework for Open Data has not been developed to operationalize the Access to Information policy. Although the existing Open Data guiding principles, developed by DECDG, incorporate a number of industry leading practices, they lack the institutional mandate and do not address some of the leading open data policy guidelines[^1] such as:

* *Mandate the release of specific new information[^2]*: A structured recurring process to identify new datasets to be "opened" is not established.
* *Create or appoint oversight authority*
* *Ensure sufficient funding for implementation*

With the growth of Open Data and the imminent organizational and senior management changes, ODI needs to be institutionalized. A comprehensive WBG level Open Data guiding framework will bring clarity and promote consistency in Open Data practices across the Bank Group and will supplement the "collaborative" and "advocacy" approach to ensure broader ODI participation across the institution.

[^2]: The "lost dataset exercise" conducted on the directive of the Managing Director to identify new datasets to be opened was a one-time exercise and is yet to be converted into a recurring periodic process.


## Management Action Plan ##

Develop and issue guidance to staff in the form of Handbook/Manual detailing:

* Requirements for identifying and releasing datasets as part of the Open Data Initiative and Access to Information policy.
* Application of the Open Data Terms of Use to datasets, including requirements for free use and re-use of data.
* Practical processes, including the management of Open Data Catalog entries, data access formats and regular, periodic reviews of data sets in conjunction with knowledge units (e.g. the new global practice groups, WBI, and DEC).
