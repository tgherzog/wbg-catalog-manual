# Process for adding datasets to the Open Data Catalog #

The Data Administration and Quality (DAQ) Team is responsible for reviewing and supervising all additions to the Open Data Catalog. All inquiries to DECDG staff regarding submissions to the Data Catalog are referred to the DAQ team to begin the formal submission process. The DAQ team coordinates with other teams as necessary throughout the submission process, in particular, Client Services and Communications (CSC) and Data and Information Systems (DIS), as well as other DECDG teams that provide subject area expertise.

The submission process begins with a consultation between the DAQ team and the Bank unit that “owns” (or sponsors) the dataset. At this initial meeting, the DAQ team informs the Bank unit of the process for submitting datasets, as described here. DAQ also informs the Bank unit of all data catalog requirements concerning data quality, technical formats, metadata, adherence the Bank’s Access to Information and Open Data Terms of Use policies, as well as the ongoing obligations of the Bank unit to maintain and update the dataset and provide support. Typically, the DAQ team and the Bank unit also discuss technical options for making the data publicly accessible (such as Databank, DDP, bulk download files, etc.).  The consultation may include a discussion of timing and schedule if, for instance, the dataset is to be released concurrent with the launch of a report. Finally, a contact person and a TTL (Task Team Leader) in the Bank unit are identified, and the two teams agree on next steps.

The DAQ team provides the Bank unit with two forms that must be completed as part of the submission process:

* The **Request form** provides a range of technical and logistical information about the database, such as the technical specifications, delivery date, who updates it, how often, when the dataset should be published, and whether the dataset is public or private. This provides necessary details for the publication process and provides the basis for the dataset’s internal documentation. Completion of this form by the Bank unit provides certification that the dataset complies with the Open Data Terms of Use and with other Open Data catalog policies.
* The **New Dataset Template form** specifies all metadata related to the dataset. This form must be completed for the dataset to be published in the Data Catalog. Some (but not all) contents of this form are displayed publicly to end users, and are indexed by the Bank’s enterprise search.

The DAQ team reviews these forms when they are returned, checks for complete information, and flags any issues for follow-up and resolution with the Bank unit. If necessary, subject experts in DECDG may review the dataset for quality, readability, and uniqueness or differentiation compared with datasets already in the catalog.

Depending on the hosting solution (as identified at the initial consultation), the DAQ team will provide technical requirements to the Bank unit for formatting the dataset and providing metadata. The DAQ team will coordinate with other DECDG staff to load the data on a QA (quality assurance) server, accessible only within the Bank, and notify the Bank unit that the dataset is ready for review. The Bank unit reviews the data and informs DAQ of any necessary changes or corrections. The Bank unit then certifies the dataset, typically by a confirmation email.

Finally, the dataset is moved to the production server. The Bank unit performs a final review in the production environment, after which the dataset is published and made publicly available. The CSC team then adds the dataset’s metadata to the Open Data catalog, and the Bank unit and relevant DEGCG staff are notified by email.

Beginning in FY 2014, DECDG will convene an advisory group to provide additional oversight of the data catalog process and coordinate forthcoming additions with other department activities. This advisory group is an extension of an existing group that meets weekly to coordinate activities on the open data website. It includes members of the DAQ, CSC and DIS teams, other DECDG staff, and External Affairs (EXT).
