## Constraints of Current Catalog

* Very high bar for entry. must meet DECDG's criteria for Open Data. No support for "inferior" datasets

* Doesn't generate its own metadata pages; these must be created separately in Drupal or another platform. This means
duplicate work and we lack a uniform presentation of metadata

* No way to enter datasets that aren't available but could be, like [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/data/search?unpublished=true)

* Assumes there is a single download for every dataset (though it may be query/bulk/api), doesn't address cases where data
  lives in multiple files [like this](http://wbi.worldbank.org/boost/country/rio-grande-do-sul-brazil).
